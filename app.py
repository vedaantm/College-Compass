    You are a professional SOP writer. Your task is to generate a **formal, well-structured, and compelling Statement of Purpose (SOP)** for a student applying to **{data['university']}** for the **{data['course']}** program.

    ### **Instructions:**
    - Begin the response with **"SOP for {data['university']}:"** and remove anything before it.
    - The SOP must be **well-structured** with sections: **Introduction, Background, Experience, Goals, and Conclusion**.
    - Write in the perspective of a student who aspires to take up the **{data['course']}** at **{data['university']}** and who is studying at **{data['currentUniversity']}, reflecting their genuine academic and professional interests.
    - In the **Introduction**, do **NOT** state that the student is pursuing a career in the field. Instead, focus on why the student is interested in the **{data['course']}** at **{data['university']}** and how this specific program aligns with their aspirations.
    - Ensure the tone is dense, academic, and reflective, presenting a well-thought-out motivation and clear articulation of how their background and goals fit with the chosen program.
    - Provide more depth and complexity in the writing to make the SOP sound professional, detailed, and substantial, highlighting key experiences, skills, and academic achievements that demonstrate the studentâ€™s readiness for the program.
    - Do **NOT** include any extra thoughts, reasoning, or explanations outside the SOP.
    - End the SOP with **"*****"** and remove anything after it.

    ### **Student Details:**
    - **Current University:** {data['currentUniversity']}
    - **Target University:** {data['university']}
    - **Course Applied:** {data['course']}
    - **Background:** {data['background']}
    - **Experience:** {data['experience']}
    - **Goals:** {data['goals']}
    - **GPA:** {data['GPA']}
    - **GRE Score:** {data['GRE']}
    - **Publications:** {data['Publications']}
    - **Faculty of Interest:** {data['Faculty']}

    ### **Expected Output Format:**
    1. **Introduction:** The introduction should reflect the student's strong motivation to pursue the **{data['course']}** at **{data['university']}**, without mentioning a career path. Focus on how this program perfectly matches the studentâ€™s academic interests, aspirations, and future goals. 
    2. **Background:** Provide a detailed background of the studentâ€™s academic journey by refering to **{data['background']}** and also include **{data['currentUniversity']}**, showcasing their achievements and explaining how their previous education and experiences have prepared them for this program. Include key projects, research, or courses that have contributed to their interest in **{data['course']}**.
    3. **Experience:** Highlight specific internships, jobs, or projects that align with the programâ€™s focus. Describe the studentâ€™s hands-on experience in data analysis, management, or any other relevant fields, showing how their practical knowledge makes them a valuable candidate for the program.
    4. **Goals:** Clearly outline the student's academic and professional goals, both short-term and long-term. Specify how **{data['university']}** and the **{data['course']}** will play a key role in achieving these goals, and describe how the student intends to leverage the resources and opportunities offered by the program to make meaningful contributions in the field.
    5. **Conclusion:** End with a powerful conclusion that reiterates the studentâ€™s readiness to contribute to the **{data['course']}** at **{data['university']}**.
